The president of the Socialist group listed the concessions obtained, and said he wanted to give “every chance to negotiation”. He warned, however, that “a vote of no confidence is possible at any time”. The vote on the motion of no confidence tabled by the “insoumis” will take place between 5:38pm and 5:58pm.
